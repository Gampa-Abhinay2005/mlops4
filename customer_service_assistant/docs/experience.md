# Experience

## Overview

Building the **Customer Service Assistant** was a great learning experience in AI, workflow automation, and scalable system design. I gained practical knowledge in integrating **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for real-time conversation analysis, automating tasks using **Prefect**, and containerizing services with **Docker**.

## Key Learnings

- **AI Integration**: Used LLMs for sentiment analysis, intent detection, and summarization to assist customer support agents in real time.
- **Workflow Automation**: Implemented **Prefect workflows** to automate tasks like ticket creation and conversation summarization.
- **Containerization**: Learned to use **Docker** to containerize services, ensuring scalability and efficient deployment.
- **Data Logging**: Utilized **MLflow** to log interactions and track system performance for continuous improvement.

This project enhanced my skills in AI, system architecture, and efficient automation.
